# vC-input made by VCode Scripts https://github.com/vCodeScripts & https://discord.gg/ePnVpZE6mA
A NoPixel Inspired Menu Script Which Opens A Popup Menu To Get Needed Information.

This Script Is Standalone, this means that it will not need any framework like ESX or QBCore to run on. Each option has 2 types, input and select in the video below I show how both options look. An example of using the menu can be found in the client.lua of the script itself. Make sure to delete this example on the live server as it just opens a input with no additional steps.

You can get 2 values out of the menu, if the submit button is clicked and all the required values are filled in, the export will return a table with all info of the options. If the escape key is clicked while the input is open the input will close and return the second callback. 
For any needed support regarding the script you can just open a ticket in our discord server. The menu expands itself with each option that is added.

vCode Team.
Have Fun!
